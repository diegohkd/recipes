- 1 can of Leite MoÃ§a (sweet condensed milk)
- 2 table spoons of cocoa power (You can use more cocoa, some recipes call for 4 spoons. You can also use chocolate powder in which case you need 7 spoons, but the Brigadeiros will be intensely sweet. With practice, you will find your own perfect recipe)
- 4 tablespoons of butter
- chocolate sprinkles
- a non-stick pan
- a wooden spoon
- mini baking cups
 

Cooking Instructions:

- put roughly 2 tablespoons of butter to melt in the pan
- set the stove top to medium-low
- once the butter is melted, add a whole can of condensed milk
- now you will add the chocolate; but wait, if you are using cocoa powder here is BetÃ¢niaâ€™s personal trick: get a glass with a bit of water and slowly add the cocoa while mixing it with the water; this is because cocoa powder does not dissolve very well in the condensed milk, so you want to totally dissolve it with a bit of water and then add the mixture to the condensed milk in the pan
- stir with the wooden spoon; you will need to stir for at least 20 minutes and it can take as long as 40 minutes; stir in circular movements and make sure you get the Brigadeiro from the sides so it does not stick there and burn
- the Brigadeiro will get thicker and thicker and will reduce in volume
- you know it is ready when a) you divide it in half with the spoon and it stays parted for a few secondst and b) you scoop some brigadeiro with the wooden spoon, turn the spoon upside down, and it holds there for an instant before falling back into the pan; the video will show this!
- when your Brigadeiro is ready, spread the content of the pan on a plate and put it in the fridge for about 30 minutes; you want it nice and firm before you roll it in balls
- to make the little balls, spread a little bit of butter in your hands and make sure to get your fingers; using a small spoon, scoop some Brigadeiro, put it in your hands, and roll it in a little ball
- roll the ball on the chocolate sprinkles to cover it completely
- place your brigadeiro in a banking cup
- repeatâ€“should yield about 25 Brigadeiros
- put Brigadeiros in the fridge for about 15-30 minutes to make them firmer
- they are ready ðŸ™‚ Bom apetite!
